## About Up4Grabs
Up4Grabs seeks to foster a community of like-minded individuals inspired by the idea of repurposing and giving new life to items that would otherwise occupy our landfills. Whether moving between living spaces, purging during spring-cleaning, or maybe you’ve held onto an item to be regifted for a little too long, we’ve all faced moments where we just needed to “let go”. 

Much like a piece of vintage furniture, Up4Grabs takes an old idea, such as a marketplace platform, and repurposes it with an exciting, innovative, and sustainable twist! 

We would like to present you, “Up4Grabs”, an environmentally-focused platform that caters to a community of like-minded individuals who wish to breathe new life into the proverb “One Person’s Trash, is Another Person’s Treasure”. 

Up4Grabs allows users to divert unwanted, but otherwise valuable items, from the landfill and into new, loving homes – but only if you are lucky enough to win the draw…
